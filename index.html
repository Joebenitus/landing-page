          <p>I am an ex-college student with a passion for technology and problem solving. I have always been fascinated with computers and I have known for a long time that my dream career is in tech. I <strong>love</strong> programming because it is a playground for my analytical mind to run wild.<br><br>
            Other than development, my hobbies include gaming and music.

          <p>I was born in Cypress, California but I spent most of my life in McKinney, Texas. Since I was a sophomore in high school, I knew that I wanted a career in tech. I was certain that going to college as a computer science major was the perfect path for me. After two semesters of general-ed classes, sub-par teachers, and cramming for tests in subjects I had no interest in, I realized that college may not be the best path for me. That was when I decided to attend a code bootcamp called <em>Epicodus</em>. As of writing this, I am finishing my first week at <em>Epicodus</em>. In one week, I have already learned more than I did in 2 semesters in college.</p>
